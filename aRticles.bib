 title={Plant Animal Interactions: An Evolutionary Approach}, ISBN={978-1-4443-1229-4}, abstractNote={Interactions between plants and animals are incredibly diverse and complex and span terrestrial, atmospheric and aquatic environments. The last decade has seen the emergence of a vast quantity of data on the subject and there is now a perceived need among both teachers and undergraduate students for a new textbook that incorporates the numerous recent advances made in the field. The book is intended for use by advanced level undergraduate and beginning graduate students, taking related courses in wider ecology degree programmes.   Very few books cover this subject and those that do are out of date.}, note={Google-Books-ID: u4jAB7_7srsC}, publisher={John Wiley & Sons}, author={Herrera, Carlos M. and Pellmyr, Olle}, year={2009}, month={Apr}, language={en} }

Vertebrate dispersal of fruits and seeds is a common feature of many modern angiosperms and gymnosperms, yet the evolution and frequency of this feature in the fossil record remain unclear. Increasingly complex information suggests that (a) plants had the necessary morphological features for vertebrate dispersal by the Pennsylvanian, but possibly in the absence of clear vertebrate dispersal agents; (b) vertebrate herbivores first diversified in the Permian, and consistent dispersal relationships became possible; (c) the Mesozoic was dominated by large herbivorous dinosaurs, possible sources of diffuse, whole-plant dispersal; (d) simultaneously, several groups of small vertebrates, including lizards and, in the later Mesozoic, birds and mammals, could have established more specific vertebrate-plant associations, but supporting evidence is rudimentary; and (e) the diversification of small mammals and birds in the Tertiary established a consistent basis for organ-level interactions, allowing for the widespread occurrence of biotic dispersal in gymnosperms and angiosperms.}, number={1}, journal={Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics}, author={Tiffney, Bruce H.}, year={2004}, month={Dec}, pages={1–29}, language={en} }
